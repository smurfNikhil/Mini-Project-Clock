# Mini-Project-Clock
To create a simple web-based digital clock using PHP and JavaScript that displays the current time in real-time.
This mini project is a basic implementation of a digital clock built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The PHP script is responsible for handling server-side time settings, while JavaScript is used to dynamically update the clock every second on the webpage.

The clock shows the current hours, minutes, and seconds, and can be extended to show date, AM/PM format, or even different time zones.
